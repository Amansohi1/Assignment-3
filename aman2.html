        <p>Use the transform, transition, and animation attributes that you have learned about web 
        animation to inform viewers that they should study about the museum. 
          <ul>
            <li> Create a perpetual animation for the library to alert visitors about its 
             identity as a library</li>
            <li> Indicate to individuals that they are hovering over the library by applying 
             a distinct animation to the button. The animation should involve the continuous 
             repetition of at least two CSS properties.</li>
            <li> Signal to individuals that they are clicking on the library button using a 
            considerably distinct and more dramatic animation, which should be noticeably 
            different from the initial two animations. </li>
            <li> Advance challenge: Utilize CSS animations to make the library image disappear 
            if the button is held down for an extended period.</li>
